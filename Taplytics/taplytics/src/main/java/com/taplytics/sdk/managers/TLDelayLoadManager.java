/**
 * TLDelayLoadManager
 *
 * This class is used to handle the different scenarios for those wishing to delay loading their application
 * in anticipation of Taplytics loading.
 *
 * This manager handles calling back when Taplytics has started. Currently relies on Taplytics.startTaplytics.
 * It short circuits if we set a max time and the callback hasn't happened yet.
 * It waits a minimum amount of time (if minimum is set) before calling back.
 *
 * Only the first set of min/max is respected. All others are ignored.
