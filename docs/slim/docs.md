#Taplytics-Android SDK

_Taplytics is a native mobile A/B testing platform that helps you optimize your Android app!_


**Current Version**: 1.1.7

##Project Setup


_How do I, as a developer, start using Taplytics?_ 

1. _Sign up for a free account at Taplytics.com._
2. _Install the SDK._
3. _Create an experiment and push it live to your users!_


### Android Studio Installation

1. _In your module’s build.gradle, add the url to the sdk._

	  ```
  repositories {                                                                                              
    maven { url "https://github.com/taplytics/Taplytics-Android-SDK/raw/master/AndroidStudio/" }
  }      
  ```
  
2. _In your module’s build.gradle dependencies, compile Taplytics._

  	```
  dependencies {                                                                   
    //Taplytics                                                                        
    compile("com.taplytics.sdk:taplytics:+@aar")                                                         
  }    
  ```
  
  
3. _Override your application’s onCreate() method (not your main activity) and call Taplytics.startTaplytics(). It should look like this:_

	```java	  	  
  public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();
      Taplytics.startTaplytics(this, "YOUR TAPLYTICS API KEY");
    }
  }
  ```
4. _Finally, add the proper permissions, and the Application class to your app’s AndroidManifest.xml in the Application tag._

 	 ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  <application
    android:name=".ExampleApplication"
    ...
  ```


5. _(Only if using Support Fragments) Add the following to your proguard rules:_

	```
  -keep class android.support.v4.app.Fragment { *; }
  -keep class android.support.v4.view.ViewPager
  -keepclassmembers class android.support.v4.view.ViewPager$LayoutParams {*;}
  ```
  
  
6. _That's it! Now build and run your app, you can start creating experiments with Taplytics!_


### Eclipse Installation

1. _Download the taplytics.jar [here](https://github.com/taplytics/Taplytics-Android-SDK/raw/master/taplytics.jar)_
2. _Copy the jar into your 'libs' directory in your project._
3. _Right click the jar in Eclipse, click Build Path > add to build path_
4. _Override your application’s onCreate() method (not your main activity) and call Taplytics.startTaplytics(). It should look like this:_

	```java
  public class ExampleApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
      super.onCreate();
      Taplytics.startTaplytics(this, "YOUR TAPLYTICS API KEY");
    }
  }
  ```
5. _Finally, add the proper permissions, and the Application class to your app’s AndroidManifest.xml in the Application tag._

  	```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  <application
    android:name=".ExampleApplication"
    ...
  ```

6. _(Only if using Support Fragments) Add the following to your proguard rules:_

	```
	-keep class android.support.v4.app.Fragment { *; }
	-keep class android.support.v4.view.ViewPager
	-keepclassmembers class android.support.v4.view.ViewPager$LayoutParams { *; }
    ```

7. _That's it! Now build and run your app, you can start creating experiments with Taplytics!_

##Usage

To use Taplytics and set up experiments, refer to [the Taplytics online docs.](https://taplytics.com/docs/)

To switch between experiments or variations in debug mode, select them on the website, or **shake the device ** and select which variation or experiment you wish to view.

###Starting Options


Taplytics can be started with a few options to help you use it during development.

First, the base method:

```java
Taplytics.startTaplytics(this, "Your Api Key");
```

Or, add a map of options.

```java
Hashmap<String, Object> options = new Hashmap<>();
options.put("optionName",optionValue);
Taplytics.startTaplytics(this, "Your Api Key");
```

Possible options are:

| Option Name  | Values | Default | Explanation
|---|---|---|---|
|liveUpdate   | boolean: true/false  | true  | Disable live update to remove the border, and activity refreshing in your debug builds to test the functionality of your applications as if they were in release mode. Note that this functionality is always disabled in release builds.  |   
| shakeMenu | boolean: true/false   | true  | In your debug builds, disable the quick menu that appears when you shake your device. This menu is never present in release builds.|   

###Code Experiments

####Setup

To set up a code experiment in Taplytics, please refer to the [Taplycs code-based experiment docs](https://taplytics.com/docs/code-experiments).

####Usage

Taplytics automatically generates the base needed for your code experiment. Paste it into the relevant section of your app, and apply the variables as necessary. 

It is suggested that you place the code calling the experiment in its own function (as opposed to an oncreate).

For example:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	setContentView(some_layout);
	
	// Run this code experiment. This triggers the experiment.
	runAnExperiment();
}
```
	
Then, in that function, add your experiment code generated by Taplytics, and modify it as you need.
	
```java
private void runAnExperiment(){
	Taplytics.runCodeExperiment("experiment name", new TaplyticsCodeExperimentListener() {
	
		@Override
		public void baselineVariation(Map<String, Object> variables) {
        
        		// Insert baseline variation code here.
        		Object myVar0 = variables.get("foo"); // can be null if no experiment is found
        	}
        	
		@Override
		public void experimentVariation(String variationName, Map<String, Object> variables) {
    	 		Object myVar0 = variables.get("foo"); // can be null if no experiment is found
    	 	
    	 		if (variationName.equals("Variation 1")) {
    	 			// Insert Variation 1 variation code here.
    	 		} else if (variationName.equals("Variation 2")) {
				// Insert Variation 2 variation code here.
			}
		}
	
		@Override
		public void experimentUpdated() {
			// Use this method to re-run your code experiments when testing your ex	periment variations.
		}
	});
}
```

This separate function is suggested, because if you would like to update experiments instantly for debug testing or another reason, you can simply place the `runAnExperiment()` function into the `experimentUpdated()` block.

###Events

####Automatic Events

Some events are automatically tracked by Taplytics and will appear on your dashboard. These events are:

* App Start
* Activity and/or Fragment load
* Activity and/or Fragment destroy
* Activity pause
* App background
* Viewpager changes

App terminate is also tracked, but this is only true when your MAIN activity is at the bottom of your activity stack, and the user exits the app from that activity.

No changes are needed in your code for this event tracking to occur. 

####Custom Events

To log your own events, simply call: 		

```java
Taplytics.logEvent("Your Event Name");
```

You can also log events with numerical values:

```java
Number num = 0;
Taplytics.logEvent("Your Event Name", num);
```
	
And with custom object data:

```java
Number num = 0;
JSONObject customInfo = new JSONObject();
customInfo.put("some title",someValue)
Taplytics.logEvent("Your Event Name", num, customInfo);
```

####Revenue Logging

Its also possible to log revenue.

Revenue logging is the exact same as event logging, only call `logRevenue`:

```java
Number someRevenue = 10000000;	
Taplytics.logRevenue("Revenue Name", someRevenue);
```
	
And similarly, with custom object data:

```java	
Number someRevenue = 10000000;
JSONObject customInfo = new JSONObject();
customInfo.put("some rag",someValue)
	
Taplytics.logRevenue("Revenue Name", someRevenue, customInfo);
```

###User Attributes

Its possible to send custom user attributes to Taplytics using a JSONObject of user info. 

The possible fields are:

|Parameter  |Type         |
|---	    |---          |
|email	    |	String    |
|name	    |	String    |
|age	    |	Number    |
|gender	    |	String    |
|customData	|	JsonObject|


Where the customData key lets you pass in custom user data as a JSONObject.

For example:

```java
JSONObject attributes = new JSONObject();
attributes.put("email", "johnDoe@taplytics.com");
attributes.put("name", "John Doe");
attributes.put("age", 25);
attributes.put("gender", "male");
attributes.put("avatarUrl", "https://someurl.com/someavatar.png");

JSONObject customData = new JSONObject();
customData.put("paidSubscriber", true);
customData.put("subscriptionPlan", "yearly");
attributes.put("customData", customData);

Taplytics.setUserAttributes(attributes);
```

###Visual Editing

All visual editing is done on the Taplytics dashboard. See the docs on visual editing [here](https://taplytics.com/docs/visual-experiments).
