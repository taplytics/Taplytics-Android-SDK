# Taplytics FAQ

### Q. Why is instant run causing slowness?

**[Here is a response from an Android Studio developer on the problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/4m2v25/instant_run_causing_incredibly_long_app_start/d3s9iox)**

### Q. Will the border or shake menu show up on our user's devices?

No.

The border and menu will only ever appear on **_debug devices_** and _release mode devices that have **previously been paired to taplytics**_.

If a user has a rooted device and modifies your application to be read as debug mode, then yes this may appear. However, if a user is doing that, you will have bigger problems than the Taplytics border.


### Q. What is 'Rejecting Re-Init on Previously Failed Classes'

If you see this:

It's nothing to worry about, at all.

Taplytics has two different networking options -- Retrofit+OkHttp, or Volley.

If you choose to use one, the classes/methods relying on the other will be purged out, and that is what you are seeing.

The animal names are how we obfuscate things!

### Q. How do I pair Taplytics to a release build?

**[You need to have add a few things to your app, as seen here.](https://github.com/taplytics/Taplytics-Android-SDK/blob/master/START.md#device-pairing)**

Also don't forget, your socket library has to be in your release builds (which may not be by default -- ask your devs!)

### Q. Does Taplytics work with Segment?

**Yes! But only with Segment v4**

Add the following to your build.gradle:

```gradle
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android:analytics:+'
compile('com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:taplytics:+')
//Change from debugCompile to compile if you would like pairing on release builds as well.
debugCompile('io.socket:socket.io-client:+') {
    // excluding org.json which is provided by Android
    exclude group: 'org.json', module: 'json'
}
```
As well as any other integrations you are using in segment.

Then, initialize Segment in your Application's onCreate:

```java
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(this, "SEGMENT_API_KEY").use(TaplyticsIntegration.FACTORY).build();
```

add a .use() for any other integrations you are using.

Remember to enable the Taplytics integration on your Segment dashboard.

### Q. Do you support visual edits on Dialogs?

**Yes, but in limited cases.**

To do this properly, you need to use a fragmentTransaction to add the fragment to the backstack. The tag used here should be the same as the tag used to show the fragment. Like so:

```java
FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
fragmentTransaction.show(someDialog);
fragmentTransaction.addToBackStack("fragment_some_dialog");
someDialog.show(fragmentTransaction, "fragment_some_dialog");
```

Taplytics tracks the appearance/disappearance of the dialog via the backstack manager, which is why it needs to be sent there. The tag is necessary to confirm that the visual edits are being applied to the correct fragment.

This only works with dialogFragments as normal Dialogs do not have any unique identifying tags.

**NOTE:**
dialogFragments exist on an entirely different view hierarchy than traditional view elements. They exist within their own `window` and have an entirely different viewRoot than the rest of your application. This makes changes on dialogs very difficult, and this feature is not 100% guaranteed to work for all dialogs.
